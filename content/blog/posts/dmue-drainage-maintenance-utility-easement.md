I recently inspected a **detention basin** for a local church in Charlotte, and immediately noticed **No Trespassing** signs around the parcel. A faint track through **tall, overgrown grass** suggested the basin hadn’t been maintained in years—common when vegetation is allowed to take over. About **200 feet into the woods**, I encountered what appeared to be an established encampment hidden from the parking lot. Given the posted signs and the safety concerns, I made the call to **stop and reschedule** the inspection. 

That moment is a clear reminder: **DMUE**—_Drainage Maintenance Utility Easement_—isn’t just for regulators. It’s what allows **safe, reliable access** so inspectors can do their jobs and owners can keep properties from **flooding** during storms.

## What is a DMUE?

A **Drainage Maintenance Utility Easement (DMUE)** is a recorded easement that preserves access to **stormwater infrastructure**—detention basins, pipes, inlets, outfalls, spillways, energy dissipators, and channels—so these assets can be **inspected, maintained, and repaired** over the life of the site. In Charlotte-Mecklenburg, DMUEs work hand-in-hand with the **Post-Construction Stormwater Ordinance (PCSO)**  to ensure stormwater controls (**SCMs/BMPs**) remain functional.

**In plain language:** a DMUE is the **right to get to** the drainage system so it can be kept working and safe.

---

## Why DMUE Access Matters

- **Safety for inspectors and contractors.** Clear, lawful access limits risk when vegetation is head-high, slopes are slick, or when there are unknown site users.
- **Compliance for owners.** PCSO requires SCMs to be **accessible** for routine inspections and maintenance.
- **Flood prevention.** If outfalls, orifices, risers, and spillways can’t be reached, **debris and sediment** accumulate—parking lots, drive aisles, basements, and roads become vulnerable.
- **Liability and cost control.** Unmaintained systems lead to erosion, sinkholes around structures, pavement failures, and **costly emergency repairs**.

## Common DMUE Issues We See in Charlotte

- **Overgrowth:** woody vegetation, vines, and briars blocking paths, headwalls, and control structures.  
- **Fences & gates without access coordination:** locked without an owner contact, or no gate at all.  
- **Encroachments:** sheds, dumpsters, trailers, or landscaping built **inside the easement**.  
- **Signage conflicts:** blanket *No Trespassing* signs without posted inspection contact info or access instructions.

## What Owners Are Responsible For (PCSO Context)

While each municipalities' permit/plan governs specifics, owners are typically responsible for:

1. **Maintaining access** within the DMUE (mowed/cleared paths wide enough for safe foot access—often 5–10 ft).  
2. **Routine maintenance** of the SCM: debris & sediment removal, vegetation management, erosion repairs, and structure upkeep.  
3. **Providing inspection access** upon request and keeping contact info current.  
4. **Correcting deficiencies** identified in inspection reports within required timelines.  

> **Note:** Always refer to your as-built plans, the operations and maintenance (O&M) plan, and current local requirements.

## How to Verify You Have a DMUE on Your Property

- **Approved Plans:** Site/Civil sheets will often show easements and any **access routes** to SCMs.  
- **As-Built / O&M Manual:** Often includes access notes, safety features, and maintenance frequencies.  
- **Ask Your Engineer or Municipality:** Planning/Stormwater can often confirm easement records and PCSO obligations.

## A Practical DMUE Access & Maintenance Checklist

**Before an inspection**
- [ ] Confirm **ownership/manager** contact and provide an inspection window.  
- [ ] Verify **DMUE limits** and where gates/paths are.  
- [ ] If signage says *No Trespassing*, ensure **written permission** or on-site escort.  
- [ ] Bring appropriate **PPE** (boots, gloves, hi-viz) and follow a **buddy system** for remote basins.  
- [ ] Pre-screen with aerials/Street View to identify **overgrowth** or steep slopes.

**Site access & safety**
- [ ] Gates unlocked or a **key/escort** available.  
- [ ] **Path cleared**: vegetation trimmed to ground, no tripping hazards.  
- [ ] **Structures visible**: riser, orifice, trash rack, outlet, and emergency spillway.  
- [ ] No **encroachments** in the easement (sheds, dumpsters, fences).  
- [ ] If you encounter **unauthorized occupants or hazards**, **stop work** and reschedule with the owner and authorities as appropriate.

**Ongoing maintenance**
- [ ] Mow/brush-cut on a **set schedule** (growing season).  
- [ ] Remove **sediment/debris** around inlets/outlets after major storms.  
- [ ] Repair **erosion** promptly; re-establish turf and armor as designed.  
- [ ] Keep **as-builts/O&M** on file and update contacts annually.  
- [ ] Log **inspections** (date, findings, photos, actions taken).

## Takeaway from Yesterday’s Site Visit

Despite posted signs, the DMUE should allow **lawful, coordinated access** to the detention basin. But **safety comes first**. When signs, overgrowth, or encampments raise risk:
- **Pause**, inform the owner/manager, and reschedule with **escorted access**.
- Restore the **DMUE corridor** (brush-cut, remove encroachments, establish a stable path).  
- Document conditions and **plan corrective maintenance** so inspections—and storm events—don’t become emergencies.
