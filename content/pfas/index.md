PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a large group of man-made chemicals that have been widely used in consumer products and industrial applications since the 1940s. These chemicals are highly persistent in the environment and can accumulate in the human body over time, leading to potential health concerns.

One type of PFAS, called PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonate), has been a particular focus of concern in the Charlotte, North Carolina area. PFOS was commonly used in firefighting foams, stain-resistant fabrics, and other products, and has been found to contaminate drinking water supplies in the region.

For Charlotte residents, there are several important things to know about PFAS and PFOS:

## Testing and Remediation
- If you are a resident of Brunswick, Columbus, New Hanover, or Pender counties, you may be eligible to have your drinking water well sampled for PFAS at no cost by contacting Chemours, the company responsible for much of the PFAS contamination in the area.
- Households connected to a municipal water supply should contact their local water utility to inquire if they have tested for PFAS and what steps they are taking to address any contamination.
- You can also request that a certified lab test your drinking water for PFAS. The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services has a list of certified labs that conduct these tests, which can cost between $300-$600.[1]
- If you rely on a private well, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services and your local health department can provide recommendations on routine well water testing, including for PFAS.
- Agricultural producers can also request PFAS testing in water through a federal program associated with the US Department of Agriculture.

## Health Concerns
- Studies in animals have linked PFAS exposure to decreased fertility, low birth weight, developmental delays, liver and kidney damage, and tumors, though the health effects in humans are still largely unknown
- The Environmental Protection Agency has established a Lifetime Health Advisory level of 70 parts per trillion (ppt) for PFOS and/or PFOA in drinking water due to potential health risks
- Researchers have found high concentrations of PFAS in drinking water sources across the United States, including in eastern North Carolina, raising concerns about potential health effects in affected communities.

By understanding the prevalence of PFAS, particularly PFOS, in the Charlotte area and taking advantage of available testing and remediation services, residents can help protect themselves and their families from the potential health risks associated with these persistent chemicals.
