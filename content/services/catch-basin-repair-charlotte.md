Broken or sinking catch basins create trip hazards, ponding, and accelerated pavement failure. We repair and rebuild commercial catch basins for industrial facilities, shopping centers, fuel stations, and trucking yards across the Charlotte metro.

## Why It Matters
- Prevents pavement collapse and sinkholes near inlets
- Stops flooding that disrupts operations and damages inventory
- Reduces risk and liability from trip hazards and ADA non‑compliance
- Protects downstream systems and helps with NPDES compliance

## Our Process
1. Site assessment and elevation check around the inlet/grates
2. Excavation and rebuild of collar, frame, and grate (as needed)
3. Adjust rings, brick/block repair, or new precast curb inlets
4. Concrete and asphalt restoration with proper compaction
5. Flow test and final inspection

## What We Work On
- Industrial facilities, factories, and warehouses
- Shopping centers and retail pads
- Fuel stations and convenience stores
- Trucking yards and logistics hubs
