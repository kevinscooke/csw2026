We focus primarily on commercial and industrial clients. **For HOAs with major repair needs**—like sinkholes, pipe failures, failing inlets/outfalls, or unsafe erosion—we can assess the problem and provide a repair plan. Routine HOA maintenance is limited.

---

## Why It Matters (for HOAs)
- **Avoid citations & fines.** Catch issues early to stay compliant with local requirements.
- **Prevent flooding & property damage.** Fix failures before they impact roads, amenities, or homes.
- **Protect dues & reserves.** A scoped repair plan reduces surprises and emergency costs.
- **Keep common areas safe and usable.** Stabilize erosion, secure structures, and restore access.
- **Confidence in next steps.** Clear findings, photos, and repair options you can share with your Board.

## When We’re the Right Fit
Choose us if your HOA is dealing with one or more of the following:
- Sinkholes near roads, parking, or storm drains
- Collapsed or separated pipes; failing catch basins/inlets
- Failing outfalls, headwalls, or end sections
- Severe erosion around channels or pond embankments
- Safety concerns that require structural repair

> **Not ideal for:** routine mowing, litter pickup, or light vegetation maintenance. If that’s your need, we’ll share referral options.

## What to Expect (Our Process)
1. **Fit check (fast):** Quick call or form review to confirm it’s a major repair issue.
2. **Site assessment:** On-site inspection with photos, measurements, and safety review.
3. **Findings & scope:** Plain-English summary, recommended fix, and budgetary pricing.
4. **Repair coordination (optional):** We can coordinate the work or connect you with qualified crews.
5. **Close-out:** Photos and documentation for Board records and compliance.
