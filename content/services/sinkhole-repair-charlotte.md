Sinkholes around storm structures, manholes, or along pipe runs are a warning sign of voids, joint failures, or washouts. We deliver root‑cause repairs that restore safety and prevent repeat failures in high‑traffic areas.

## Our Process

2. Excavation to stable subgrade; replace failed backfill
3. Repair/replace structures, joints, or laterals as needed
4. Compaction in lifts; restore pavement to spec
5. Final QA and monitoring recommendations
